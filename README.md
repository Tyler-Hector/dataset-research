# HUVTSP Technical Team 5 — Vanguard Defense

## Overview
This repository contains all files and resources for **HUVTSP Technical Team 5’s** project with **Vanguard Defense**.  
The goal is to develop a **real-time anti-ballistic missile trajectory prediction model** to track and intercept fast-moving, evasive airborne threats.

## Problem Statement
Military defense systems require accurate trajectory prediction to determine optimal interception paths in real time. This is critical for national security and minimizing potential damage.
